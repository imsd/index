			+ it's like a container
		2. it can be changed (subtract, add, etc)
		3. it has a name
		4. it has a type

	+ examples
		+ Vector3 nameBlah = new Vector3(x,y,z);
		+ float someFloatName = 1f;

	+ code blocks
		`void someFunction() {
			// a code block is demarcated by
			// the curly brackets!
		}`

	+ built-in functions in Unity
		`void Start() {
			
		}

		void Update() {

## Challenge
	1. Create a blank Unity project that has:

	2. Additional challenges
		+ Rotate the platform with a script
		+ Spawn more than one type of object
