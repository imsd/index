## About

This course is an overview of protocols used in the production of interactive media. In this course we will explore theories, models, and frameworks that enable new media projects to traverse the digital physical membrane, online and offline networks, the video pipeline, wireless channels, and more. Students will demonstrate an understanding of these topics by completing weekly lab assignments and larger collaborative projects.

After taking this course, students will be able to: Program and distribute graphical, interactive applications; Recognize and utilize the appropriate terminology for interactive systems; Create and utilize open source code; Enlist physical devices to transmit wireless information to digital systems; Understand digital graphics theory in a production environment; Understand and leverage the video pipeline with Syphon & Unity.
