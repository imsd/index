## Review proposals for IoT projects

## Unity Weather Simulator

+ The idea is to take realtime weather info from https://www.metaweather.com/api and render it inside of Unity

+ Find other locations w https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/search/?query=cityname

+ This can take many forms, but as a jumping off point I've created a kind of snow globe version of NYC that simply renders the weather conditions of the city. If the API returns "light rain" then the Unity scene renders light rain, and so on.
+ Do take this as an opportunity to run wild with the concept. There are likely APIs for every city in the world, APIs for outter space stats, and so on.
